# About the site
This site was created to provide a central hub for all information that could be relevant to 2020 protestors. All are invited to collaborate. Please contact charlesaverill20@gmail.com or @caverill_ on Twitter to contribute. 

# Site data
This site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Neither of these organizations collects user data from the site.

I also have a Google Analytics plugin installed. The Analytics ID can be found in [the config file](_config.yml). I just like knowing how effective I am at spreading awareness of the site.

The "Share to Twitter" button at the top uses [Twitter's JavaScript API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview). There is a "dnt" option for the button that prevents Twitter from using user data. However, I believe this option is deprecated, because when I implemented it, the button broke and only the tag text was displayed on the site. If anyone can find out how to fix this, let me know ASAP. I want to minimalize all user data obtained, temporary or permanent.

# Sources
I don't have access to protests, as I'm 17 and I'm not allowed to go. I spend time researching these topics online, keeping an eye out for testimonials and WikiHow articles. Please let me know if you find any discrepancies in my posts, and I'll change them ASAP.
