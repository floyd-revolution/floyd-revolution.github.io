I am attempting to gather testimonials from people who have attended the recent protests. I'd like for people from any city to be able to read about what the protests are like in their city. I would like to interview protestors for 5-10 minutes to ask them about their experiences while protesting.

The interviews can occur through phone calls, twitter DMs, emails, Skype, whatever you're comfortable with. I won't use your name, but I would like to use your age, race, and gender (You can opt out of any of these if it makes you uncomfortable). 

Please contact me [via email](mailto:charlesaverill20@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Contribute) or on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/caverill_) if you'd like to be interviewed.

Thank you!

Charles
