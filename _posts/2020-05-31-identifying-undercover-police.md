# Strange License Plates / Car mods
- License plates are a tricky issue. Rules and regulations for unmarked police cars vary greatly from city to city, and state to state. Some things to look out for are:
  - No letters in the plate number
  - "Exempt" or "XMT" along the side of the plate
  - Obscured plates
- Car mods are more straightforward. Look out for:
  - Extra antennae
  - Extra lights, especially pairs of lights, where they normally wouldn't be
  - Push bumpers
  - Dark window tints
