## Your rights
- Owners of private property can determine what speech is allowed on their property. Protesting in public areas such as streets, sidewalks, and parks is the safest option.
- While on public property, you may photograph "anything in plain view", including police and federal property.
- Permits are not required to protest, given that you are not obstructing traffic. If obstructing traffic, police may move you to sidewalks to let others pass.

## Rights of Police to disperse protests
- Police may not disperse protestors unless there is "clear and present danger of riot"
- Police must issue clear and detailed notice of dispersal orders, and allow for sufficient time to vacate the area.

## ACLU Legal Observers
- "The purpose of legal observers is to monitor, record, and report on any unlawful or improper behaviour."
- Anyone may request an ACLU legal observer to monitor a protest. ACLU legal observers are neutral protest attendees who will record their observations during a protest. They will be wearing a clearly visible blue "ACLU Legal Observer" vest to identify themselves.
- Legal observers for Texas can be found [here](https://action.aclu.org/aclu-texas-legal-observers-request), and observers for other states can be found by searching "ACLU legal observer request [state]"
