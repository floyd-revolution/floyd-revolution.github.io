- Protestor A (18, White Hispanic, Female)
  - Q: Could you describe your experience at the protests?
    - A: Upon first arriving to the protest, everyone was gathered together and everything was completely peaceful. People were passing out masks, gloves, food, and snacks to anyone who needed. Our march from discovery green to city hall was completely peaceful the entire time and I saw absolutely no looting or fighting. Once we arrived to city hall we were standing there chanting and listening to the speakers on the [building's] steps. We saw a white individual whose face was completely covered with a black rag and they had what appeared to be an AK-47 strap around them, and that's when we decided to leave the protest. I personally didn't withness anything voilent or crazy and it seemed peaceful from 2PM-4PM when I was there.
  - Q: Did you ever feel threatened by the police or another group? Was there a police presence at all?
    - A: Yes there was a lot of police present. I noticed some officers inside of nearby businesses and even on the top of buildings with snipers. I personally never felt threatened, but I did [witness] some people yelling at them andd one woman flicking an officer off
  - Q: Were there any counter-protestors?
