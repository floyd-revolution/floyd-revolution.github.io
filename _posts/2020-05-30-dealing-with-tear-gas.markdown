## How to deal with it immediately
1. Move to fresh air
  - Try to move to high ground. Tear Gas settles to the ground after deployment
  - If the canister was deployed inside, exit the building, and vice versa.
2. Flush your eyes with one of the following
  - COLD water
  - Milk (reportedly not as effective)
  - Solution consisting of 3 teaspoons of Baking Soda, 8.5 ounces of water.
    - 8.5 ounces is a bit more than this kind of Purell bottle: ![purell_bottle](https://mcdonaldpaper.com/media/catalog/product/cache/757ea7d2b7282843694bdb6de7a23598/p/u/purell8.jpg)

## Neutralize Deployed Canisters
YOU SHOULD ONLY APPROACH A DEPLOYED CANISTER IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT FACE PROTECTION (GOGGLES, NOSE/MOUTH FILTER, GAS MASK)

### Traffic cone method
1. Place a traffic cone over the deployed canister.
2. Pour water into the top of the traffic cone to put out the canister. The canisters used by Hong Kong police have been noted to be unusually small. Expect to use mutliple bottles of water to put out larger canisters.

### Return to sender
- To handle canisters, gloves MUST be worn or you may risk 2nd-degree burns.
- Tennis rackets, hockey sticks, any long object can be used to hit canisters away from protestors.
